The Orienteering Problem with Drones

This public repository contains the instances, the parameter settings and the computational results of the runs mentioned in the paper (see below for the bibliographic reference).

UPDATE April 19th, 2024: A bug in the script that handles the input of the runs was discovered and corrected. Only the instances poi-40-* with a beta parameter different from 1 were affected; the correct results show minor differences in the solution gap and solution count of these instances. The file solutions/OP-mD/MainComputationsReport.csv has been accordingly updated. Our gratitude goes to Xuan Ren (Northwestern Polytechnical University, China) for pointing out the issue.
